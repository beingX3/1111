# Vite Typescript React 17

ImageConverter uses a mix of Vite, TypeScript, and React 17 to create a modern web application. It also server renders its pages.
It also imports Tailwind CSS for the CSS framework

## Development

```
yarn
yarn dev
```

That should be enough to get started. It will open to http://localhost:7456

## Building

```
yarn build
yarn serve
```

yarn build will create the assets in `dist` - a `client` and `server` folder.
